# Mc Server

This is an implementation of a minecraft server in Rust.
You *can* use it's libs to create your own server, but i do not provide any documentation *yet*, but i do not recomend so because it is still in very early stage of development.\
I will use it to create a server when it will be mature enough.

## Inspirations
Special thanks to the [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) community!\
I used the same packet naming as [MCHPRS](https://github.com/MCHPR/MCHPRS), and i took some crates and ways of doing things from [feather](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather)
